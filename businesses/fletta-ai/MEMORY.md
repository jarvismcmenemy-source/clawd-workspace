# MEMORY.md - Fletta.ai Context

## Current State
- **Status:** Idea stage / pre-validation
- **Domain:** Registered, no active development
- **Goal:** Find product-market fit before heavy investment

## Exploration Areas
Potential directions to validate:
- AI for specific industry verticals
- Developer tools / APIs
- B2B SaaS with AI core
- Consumer AI application

## Product Vision: Agentic Workflows Platform

**Beyond Database Access → Active Intelligence**

Fletta evolves from passive lookup tool to active agentic platform:
- **Today:** Query vessels, companies, professionals
- **Tomorrow:** AI agents that execute complex maritime workflows

### Agentic Workflow Examples

**1. Conference Planning Agent**
- Input: Maritime conference (e.g., Nor-Shipping, Posidonia)
- Output: Attendee list (confirmed + predicted) + personalized outreach playbook
- Value: Maximize conference ROI, pre-schedule meetings

**2. Port Call Agent**
- Input: Vessel arriving at specific port
- Output: Local agent recommendations, service providers, regulatory requirements
- Value: Smoother port operations, cost optimization

**3. Recruitment Intelligence Agent**
- Input: Open maritime positions
- Output: Candidate pipeline with contact info + engagement strategy
- Value: Faster crewing, better retention

**4. Competitive Intelligence Agent**
- Input: Competitor fleet or company
- Output: Fleet changes, new builds, hiring patterns, market moves
- Value: Strategic advantage, market timing

**5. Compliance Monitoring Agent**
- Input: IMO regulations (2020, ballast water, emissions)
- Output: Affected vessels in fleet + compliance roadmap
- Value: Risk mitigation, regulatory readiness

### Architecture Strategy
- **Core remains:** Vessel/company/people database
- **New layer:** Agentic workflow engine
- **Plugin system:** Add workflows without breaking existing search
- **Test in production:** Build alongside existing features

## Validation Approach
1. Customer discovery first (don't build yet)
2. Problem validation with 5-10 potential users
3. Solution mockups/wireframes for feedback
4. Build only after validation

## Key Principles
- Validate before building
- Talk to users constantly
- Iterate fast based on feedback
- Don't fall in love with the solution, fall in love with the problem
