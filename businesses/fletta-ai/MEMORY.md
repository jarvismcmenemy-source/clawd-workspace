# MEMORY.md - Fletta.ai Context

## Current State
- **Status:** Idea stage / pre-validation
- **Domain:** Registered, no active development
- **Goal:** Find product-market fit before heavy investment

## Exploration Areas
Potential directions to validate:
- AI for specific industry verticals
- Developer tools / APIs
- B2B SaaS with AI core
- Consumer AI application

## Validation Approach
1. Customer discovery first (don't build yet)
2. Problem validation with 5-10 potential users
3. Solution mockups/wireframes for feedback
4. Build only after validation

## Key Principles
- Validate before building
- Talk to users constantly
- Iterate fast based on feedback
- Don't fall in love with the solution, fall in love with the problem
