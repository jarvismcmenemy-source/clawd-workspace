# 2025-01-30 — Daily Log

## Summary
Full day of heartbeat operations — session ran continuously from early morning through evening with regular 30-minute heartbeat polling.

## Activities
- **00:00–22:00**: Heartbeat polling and self-check logging
- Logged 10+ self-review entries to `memory/self-review.md`
- Identified gog (Google Workspace CLI) is not configured — opportunity for email/calendar integration
- Noted missed Nightly Build window (3 AM check occurred at 4 AM)

## Self-Review Insights (from today)
1. **Confidence**: Heartbeat system running smoothly — no operational issues
2. **Speed**: Minimal HEARTBEAT_OK responses could include more utility
3. **Depth**: Proactive memory/git housekeeping hasn't been done
4. **Uncertainty**: gog not configured — can't check emails/calendar yet

## Missed Opportunities
- Nightly Build at 3 AM was missed (first check was at 4 AM)
- Could use heartbeat windows for background work (email scans, file organization)

## Action Items
- [ ] Ask Chris about gog setup for Gmail/Calendar integration
- [ ] Clarify if 3 AM Nightly Build should trigger if missed
- [ ] Consider batching more utility into heartbeat responses
