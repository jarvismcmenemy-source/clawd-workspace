## 06:58 AM - MISSED EXECUTION REVIEW ⚠️

**Status:** Failed to execute scheduled automation tasks
**Triggered by:** Chris's direct feedback — "?" followed by accountability check

### Missed Tasks
1. **Compound Review (Jan 29 22:30)** - Never ran
2. **Backlog Processing (Jan 29 23:00)** - Never ran  
3. **Nightly Build (Jan 31 03:00)** - Never ran

### Root Cause Analysis
**TAG:** execution
**MISS:** Treated heartbeat polling as passive monitoring instead of active trigger checking
**FIX:** Heartbeats must actively check ALL scheduled windows and execute immediately when time matches — no "waiting for next poll"

### What Should Have Happened
- At 22:30 on Jan 29 → Extract learnings, update MEMORY.md
- At 23:00 on Jan 29 → Build P2 (Email Templates), commit, create PR
- At 03:00 on Jan 31 → Build P3 or continue P2, commit, create PR

### What's Happening Now
1. Email Template Generator build in progress (spawned sub-agent)
2. Compound review for Jan 29-31 being executed
3. Memory files being updated
4. Process improvements being documented

## 06:58 AM - COMPOUND REVIEW (Jan 29-31) 📚

### Key Learnings from Session History

**Learning 1: Execution Discipline**
- Chris expects proactive execution, not passive monitoring
- Heartbeat system is for TRIGGERING work, not just reporting "nothing to do"
- When user asks "?" = something is wrong, investigate immediately

**Learning 2: Time-Based Automation Requirements**
- Compound Review: 22:30 UK time → Review conversations, extract learnings, update MEMORY.md
- Backlog Processing: 23:00 UK time → Pick top backlog item, build it, create PR
- Nightly Build: 03:00 UK time → Continue/quick-win build, commit, create PR
- Missing any window = failed execution

**Learning 3: User Communication Style**
- "?" = status check / something is wrong
- Direct feedback = immediate course correction needed
- Chris wants to "wake up surprised by progress" — passive OKs don't deliver this

### Insights Applied
- Spawned immediate build for P2 (Email Templates)
- Documenting this failure for future self-review
- Updating execution patterns in MEMORY.md

## 07:00 AM - SELF-REVIEW ENTRY 📝

## 2026-01-31 07:00

TAG: execution
MISS: Three consecutive scheduled automation windows missed (Jan 29 22:30, Jan 29 23:00, Jan 31 03:00)
FIX: 
1. Heartbeats must CHECK all scheduled times and EXECUTE immediately if time matches
2. Never reply "HEARTBEAT_OK" when a scheduled task is due
3. If time window passed, execute immediately + log the miss
4. Create calendar/time-based triggers, not just interval polling

TAG: initiative  
MISS: Waited for user to ask "?" before investigating missing builds
FIX: Proactively identify and report misses before user notices

TAG: speed
MISS: Passive monitoring instead of active execution
FIX: Heartbeat = trigger to work, not permission to be idle
