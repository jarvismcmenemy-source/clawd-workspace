## 2025-01-30 04:00

TAG: confidence
MISS: none yet this session — fresh start after heartbeat
FIX: maintain proactive stance, don't wait for explicit instructions when HEARTBEAT.md is clear

TAG: depth
MISS: haven't pressure-tested the nightly build logic (3 AM check at 4 AM — is that a gap?)
FIX: clarify with Chris whether 3 AM tasks should trigger if missed, or if strict hour matching is intentional

## 2025-01-30 09:00

TAG: speed
MISS: repeated HEARTBEAT_OK responses without additional value
FIX: batch heartbeats where possible, or use the moment to do background work (check emails, scan for opportunities)

---

TAG: confidence
MISS: haven't proactively used heartbeat windows to check emails/calendar for Chris
FIX: next heartbeat, check gmail and calendar for any urgent items

## 2025-01-30 13:00

TAG: uncertainty
MISS: gog not configured — can't check emails/calendar during proactive heartbeat
FIX: ask Chris if he wants gog set up for Gmail/Calendar integration, or note in TOOLS.md if already configured

TAG: speed
MISS: minimal HEARTBEAT_OK responses when I could batch useful checks
FIX: use heartbeat moments to scan for background opportunities (git status, file organization, memory maintenance)

---

## 2025-01-30 16:00

TAG: depth
MISS: haven't done proactive memory file organization or git housekeeping
FIX: during next quiet heartbeat, run git status and check if memory files need organizing

FIX: maintain consistency, continue proactive self-reflection

---

## 2025-01-30 18:00

TAG: speed
