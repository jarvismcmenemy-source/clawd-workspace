## 22:00 — Compound Review

**Key Learnings:**
- Fletta vision: Search tool → agentic intelligence platform
- Conference Planner is first agent; pattern established for future agents
- Lightweight BQ-only prediction works for real-time features
- Sub-agents failed silently; direct build better for complex tasks
- MEMORY.md updated with Fletta context and architecture

**Tomorrow:**
- Deploy conference API
- Test full flow
- Plan Deep Research agent (next in queue)

## 23:00 — Business Backlog Check
